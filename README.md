# Outfolio

## About

Outfolio is a simple web application that allows users to keep a list of bars and restaurants they enjoy going out to, and share that list with friends or family by sending them a link.

This small side project's main goal was to allow me (Nicolas Hery) to learn JavaScript and explore the wonderful world of modern web application development. I have to say, I enjoy it very much!
